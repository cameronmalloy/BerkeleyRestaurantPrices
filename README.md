# ESPM155AC Final Project
This project was an attempt to juxtapose the differences in price and healthyness from where UC Berkeley students typically lived and outside of where those students lived. We deemed the "student-living" areas to be the zip codes 94704 and 94709 whereas the rest of the zip codes corresponding to Berkeley was the population where we did not expect students to typically live.

# My Part
I was tasked to try to show that the prices in "student areas" were cheaper than those outside of "student areas". Since I was the only one tasked to do this, I did not have the time to collect a large enough random sample to represent the population. So I used Yelp's API to gather the data, which made my sample essentially a census. It might be worth noting that this was the first time I ever worked with an API.
I used the data.py file in the Projects folder ([a relative link] (Project/data.py)) to gather all the data from the Yelp API. I deleted my secret in the file since this file is for proof of work.
