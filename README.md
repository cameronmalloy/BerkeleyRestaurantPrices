#ESPM155AC Final Project
This project was an attempt to juxtapose the differences in price and healthyness from where UC Berkeley students typically lived and outside of where those students lived. We deemed the "student-living" areas to be the zip codes 94704 and 94709 whereas the rest of the zip codes corresponding to Berkeley was the population where we did not expect students to typically live.
